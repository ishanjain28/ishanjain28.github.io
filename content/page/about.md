My name is **Ishan Jain** and I am a *Student* and *Part-Time Backend Engineer*. I've been programming for the past 4 years and absolutely love building stuff. Currently, My [Friend](https://sowmayjain.com) and I, run multiple Fintech related websites like [Clonefolio](https://clonefolio.com). I did Front End Web Development for a short period of about a year but didn't liked it. So, I switched my focus towards *Backend* and *Distributed Systems* and I am glad I made this choice. I also like to study, solve puzzle and build stuff related to fields like *Cryptography* and *Image Processing* and sometimes play some games as well. 

I believe in choosing the right tool for the job, So, I experimented and learned some languages like Go, Rust, Node.js, Python and C. I mostly like to use Rust and Go.
